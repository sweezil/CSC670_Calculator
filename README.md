# CSC670_Calculator

This is a work in progress built during a single class session for my current User Interface Engineering Graduate level course.  It is currently only able to provide a number value through the buttons and unable yet to perform any operations on the number input.  The Clear and Clear Everything buttons currently work but may change as the project develops further.

Eventually, this application will be the framework for building and expanding into a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator.
