# CSC670_Calculator

Standard Calculator to perform basic math operations including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square roots, and inversion.  

This is a work still in progress, built during a single class session for my current User Interface Engineering Graduate level course.  It is currently only able to provide a number value through the buttons and unable yet to perform any operations on the number input.  The Clear and Clear Everything buttons currently work but may their functionality change/evolve as the project develops further.

Eventually, this application will be the framework for building and expanding into a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator.
